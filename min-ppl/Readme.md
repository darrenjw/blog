# A mimimal probabilistic programming language (PPL) in Scala

Resources for a blog post on writing a minimal PPL: **Write your own general-purpose monadic probabilistic programming language from scratch in 50 lines of (Scala) code**

If you have [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed, you can compile and run the examples with `sbt run`, or run some tests with `sbt test` (slow), or generate compile the [tut](http://tpolecat.github.io/tut/) document that formed the draft of the post with `sbt tut`.
